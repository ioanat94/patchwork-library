## 📖 About

Patchwork Library is an intentionally simple React application that serves two purposes:

1. **For Contributors**: Practice real-world collaborative development through Git workflows, code reviews, and issue tracking
2. **For Learners**: Access a curated collection of full-stack development learning resources

The project starts with basic functionality, creating opportunities for contributors to implement features like search, filtering, categorization, and UI enhancements.

### 🎓 Learning by Doing

**⚠️ WARNING: This repository contains intentional bugs, broken features, and deliberate mistakes!**

We believe the best way to learn is by finding and fixing real problems. This isn't just about missing features - we've **intentionally added bugs** for you to discover and fix:

- 🐛 **Intentional bugs** - Broken links, layout issues, styling problems, logic errors
- 🔧 **Missing functionality** - No search? No filters? That's intentional! Add them.
- 🎨 **UI improvements needed** - Basic layout waiting for your creative touch
- 🧪 **Test coverage gaps** - More components need tests
- 📝 **Documentation to expand** - Help make the docs even better
- ♿ **Accessibility enhancements** - There's always room to improve a11y

**Yes, some things are broken on purpose!** If you find something that doesn't work right, congratulations - you've found a learning opportunity. Open an issue, submit a fix, and level up your debugging skills.
